            “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of
            the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares,
            others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that
            aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

            Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
            Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is

                Orphan is a little too slick for its own good. It looks and
                feels stylistically like so many other films, which in turn made
                it difficult for me to really recall anything specific about the
                film other than the final act. I did remember that I was
                surprised at how much I liked it, so I gave it a re-watch. It is
                much better than you might expect it to be. Isabelle Fuhrman,
                who plays the titular orphan, is phenomenal and really makes the
                film work. Vera Farmiga is great but I grew very tired of the
                frequent weeping sessions, which she tends to lean on a bit too
                much. Peter Sarsgaard is creepy, and not in a good way. More in
                the completely two-dimensional male ego way. There is a sort of
                weak backstory for the family that’s entirely unnecessary, not
                really used, and barely even touched on. I wouldn’t consider
                this my first choice if I were digging through the archives
                looking for something to watch, but it isn’t half bad for a
                back-up plan. If it wasn’t for Isabelle Fuhrman’s performance,
                I’d pass this one over completely.
